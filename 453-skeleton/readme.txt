Add the textures (1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg, and 4.jpg) to the directory build/out/x64-Debug.
Download the aasignment 4 skeleton code from D2L, and copy my versions of Geometry.cpp,
Geometry.h, main.cpp, test.frag, and test.vert into the skeleton code. Finally, use cmake 
to generate an executable and run that executable to generate my simulation. I tried my best, but
unfortunately other committments made it so I wasn't able to spend as much time as I would have liked
on this assignment. I am still pretty proud of the result. You can pause the simulation by pressing
the 'P' key.
